# Microeconometrics Methods

This repository has problem set and own-developed codes (mostly in R) for the graduate courses of Microeconometrics I and II, ministered by professors Bruno Ferman and VÃ­tor Possebom at FGV-EESP.
A more complete set of materials can be found at Professor Possebom's [website](https://sites.google.com/site/vitorapossebom/professional-ex?authuser=0).

These courses cover a lot of methods in Microeconometrics and in casual inference more generally:

- Experiments, multiple outcomes, bootstrap and randomization inference;
- Selection on observables and the CIA identification assumption: doubly robust estimators, propensity scores and more;
- Instrumental Variables: LATEs and MTEs;
- Regression Discontinuity Design;
- Partial identification;
- Panel methods and inference;
- Difference-in-differences: classic design and recent developments;
- Synthetic controls;
- Inference with few treated units and clusters.
